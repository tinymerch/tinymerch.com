We wanted the barrier to entry to\nbe nonexistent, anyone with a site could sell merch directly to visitors.</p>\n<p>For many people, this creates a revenue stream that requires no effort on their\npart to maintain or operate. That's an incredibly exciting statement to make,\nand not many companies get to use a statement like that in their marketing. But\nthere was one piece of advice we received early on that seemed so perfect we\ncouldn't help but try and implement it. That feedback was to add an option to\ndonate profits to charity!</p>\n<p>This advice felt like a no-brainer. It allows people to quickly set up a\nfundraiser and start raising money, not just for themselves, but as a way of\nhelping others.</p>\n<p>So to start, we're offering the option to donate profits to ricebowls. An\namazing non-profit based in our own beautiful Greenville, SC. Ricebowls works to\nprovide food to orphanges around the world.</p>\n<p>We're actively working to add more charities to this list all the time!

We\'ll be spinning up a TinyMerch Blog (Launching next week!) where we’ll be regularly posting updates, along with helpful tips on setting up your store. We’ve also been working on rounding out our Product Catalog for the Hackathon Launch. We’re currently looking to launch with shirts, prints, and digital files.

As we finish setting this up, we\'d love to hear from you all about which charities you\'d wish to see available for donations.</p>\n<p>(And for the less benevolent amongst you. . .The answer is yes, our accountant has said this would most likely be deductible.)</p>\n<h3>Feedback Survey:</h3>\n<p><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/t8K8xDOgWTOry5Ew1">https://goo.gl/forms/t8K8xDOgWTOry5Ew1</a></p>\n<p>Interested in getting these updates in your inbox?\n(<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/tiny-merch">Sign Up for Our Newsletter</a>)</p>\n<p>✌️ Best,\nThe Tiny Team</p>',id:"/Users/aeryk/Sites/Nicer/TinyMerch/tinymerch/website/src/pages/11-17-2017-upcoming-02/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{date:"2017-11-17",path:"/blog/upcoming-02",tags:["second"],title:"Tiny Update #02",postTitle:"Hello Again",postGreeting:"👋 everyone,",postPreview:"Just a quick update on progress here at TinyMerch.
