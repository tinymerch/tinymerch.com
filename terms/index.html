We consider many different and often divergent factors before coming to a decision about what is best for our company, communities, and clients. Because we are a creatively neutral company, we err on the side of freedom of expression. We also tend to allow items that have educational, historical, or artistic value, but we know that even those items are subject to a variety of valid and sometimes conflicting interpretations and emotional responses. Art and history can be provocative, emotional, and divisive. There are some topics on which we may never reach a consensus as a society, and that is okay.</p><h5 data-reactid="72">Third-Party Services.</h5><p data-reactid="73">Our stores on our site(s) may contain links to third-party websites or services that we don’t own or control (for example, links to Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest).

When you access these third-party services, you do so at your own risk. The third parties may require you to accept their own terms of use. TinyMerch Inc. is not a party to those agreements; they are solely between you and the third party. Warranties.

You use the Services solely at your own risk. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, so the above limitations may not apply to you Liability Limits. To the fullest extent permitted by law, neither TinyMerch Inc., nor our employees or directors shall be liable to you for any lost profits or revenues, or for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special, or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with the Services or these Terms. In no event shall TinyMerch Inc.’s aggregate liability for any damages exceed the greater of one hundred ($100) US Dollars or the amount you paid TinyMerch Inc. in the past twelve months, whichever is least. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.</p><h5 data-reactid="76">Indemnification (or What Happens If You Get Us Sued)</h5><p data-reactid="77"><!-- react-text: 78 -->We hope this never happens, but in the instance TinyMerch Inc. should get sued because of something that you did, you agree to defend and indemnify us. That means you’ll defend TinyMerch Inc. (including any of our employees) and hold us harmless from any legal claim or demand (including reasonable attorney’s fees) that arises from your actions, your use (or misuse) of our Services, your breach of the Terms, or your account’s infringement of someone else’s rights. <!-- /react-text --><br data-reactid="79"/><br data-reactid="80"/><!-- react-text: 81 -->We reserve the right to handle our legal defense however we see fit, even if you are indemnifying us, in which case you agree to cooperate with us so we can execute our strategy.<!-- /react-text --></p><h5 data-reactid="82">Disputes with TinyMerch Inc.</h5><p data-reactid="83">If you’re upset with us, let us know right away, and hopefully we can resolve your issue. But if we can’t, then these rules will govern any legal dispute involving our Services:</p><h5 data-reactid="84">Governing Law.</h5><p data-reactid="85">The Terms are governed by the laws of the State in which TinyMerch resides as an organizational facility, without regard to its conflict of laws rules, and the laws of the United States of America. These laws will apply no matter where in the world you live, but if you live outside of the United States, you may be entitled to the protection of the mandatory consumer protection provisions of your local consumer protection law.</p><h5 data-reactid="86">Arbitration.</h5><p data-reactid="87">You and TinyMerch Inc. agree that any dispute or claim arising from or relating to the Terms shall be finally settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rule in effect at that time (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms you can find them here or by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879). Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under the Terms will take place on an individual basis—class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to the Terms, you and TinyMerch Inc. are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to bring an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable or conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator. You may instead assert your claim in “small claims” court, but only if your claim qualifies, your claim remains in such court, and your claim remains on an individual, non-representative, and non-class basis.</p><h5 data-reactid="88">Costs of Arbitration.</h5><p data-reactid="89">Payment for any and all reasonable AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules. If the value of your claim does not exceed $10,000, TinyMerch Inc. will pay for the reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.</p><h5 data-reactid="90">Forum.</h5><p data-reactid="91">We’re based in multiple states so any legal action against TinyMerch Inc. related to our Services must be filed and take place in the state of choice solely reserved by TinyMerch Inc. That means the seat of any arbitration shall be in any state TinyMerch chooses. For any actions not subject to arbitration, you (where your contract is with TinyMerch Inc.) and TinyMerch Inc. agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in Greenville County, SC.</p><h5 data-reactid="92">Changes to the Terms and Conditions of Content</h5><p data-reactid="93">We may update these Terms from time to time.
