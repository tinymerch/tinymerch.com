It usually means\nrebuilding your site or sending customers to a separate platform with monthly\nfees. Simply put, it’s a big commitment.</p>\n<p><strong>TinyMerch solves this.</strong> You don’t have to change your website. You never pay\na subscription fee. You don’t have to worry about inventory or shipping. We\nprocess orders, get the products printed on-demand, ship them to your customers,\nand send you profits monthly. 💸</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-link"\n    href="/static/dash-74effa7a5d8a9877d099a7b6595414a8-9f6e6.png"\n    style="display: block"\n    target="_blank"\n    rel="noopener"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 59.333333333333336%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAMCAYAAABiDJ37AAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAABOklEQVQoz52SO07EMBCG96gLVNyAV8EVoKYCiQJqxB0oInGErdmQ+JX4lQzz2zgEVizLWvo11iT+5vd4FjHGJyJaFY3juFqeCpbcS4thGKqmDeSdI94TA2l50hJDJx1dCDq+FHR4nvcHZ19x/h+UgG+1I6U0aa0T8OZRkxSSBMt7n3K76OrWZKC1lmKIhIUPD8+GnPNkrUuKcZjcb1vXd5/Aun4nJdUE1Lpnd4Kk3HS4E1AqT6YL34CIfZfBIYTksO/7VACOlVLpn+Ie6+W1y8B5lTkQhwEJ3A4cQmsAh9q25dyYWuJ9NmOM/R0IAI9UOoQcIsAQ8uUB5634E1j6B5eIxaExJjn82dOtQLjIvctXR4EiXLFpmql3G0BUdjzYBSiESdD/Skp+FL7OvXe+KuL5q9ZrwaMk99IHRit/sm8QNHMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="TinyMerch Dashboard"\n        title=""\n        src="/static/dash-74effa7a5d8a9877d099a7b6595414a8-fb8a0.png"\n        srcset="/static/dash-74effa7a5d8a9877d099a7b6595414a8-1a291.png 148w,\n/static/dash-74effa7a5d8a9877d099a7b6595414a8-2bc4a.png 295w,\n/static/dash-74effa7a5d8a9877d099a7b6595414a8-fb8a0.png 590w,\n/static/dash-74effa7a5d8a9877d099a7b6595414a8-526de.png 885w,\n/static/dash-74effa7a5d8a9877d099a7b6595414a8-fa2eb.png 1180w,\n/static/dash-74effa7a5d8a9877d099a7b6595414a8-9f6e6.png 1200w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h3>Our Place in the Market</h3>\n<p>Most ecommerce platforms are built for larger companies. TinyMerch is built for\nthe little guys: content creators 📽️, artists 👨‍🎨, bands 🎸, and small businesses\n🏪. For these users, selling merch shouldn’t be a full-time job, and TinyMerch\nis designed to make the process as fast and easy as possible. No other platform\ncombines fully-managed printing and fulfillment with an embeddable store that\nlives directly on your site, all for free.</p>\n<h3>How It Works</h3>\n<p><strong>Getting started is easy.</strong> Choose from our selection of products and upload\nyour own custom designs. We generate high-resolution print files and make your\nproduct instantly available for purchase in your store. Paste a small embed\nscript onto your website, and customers can purchase the products you just\ndesigned. Choose to receive profits monthly, or donate those profits directly to\na charity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Under the Hood</h3>\n<p>This month we built an embeddable storefront that handles purchases, a dashboard\napp for creating products and customizing your store, and a marketing site at\ntinymerch.com.</p>\n<p>We use a lot of cool tech 🤖, but here’s the core stuff that makes it happen:</p>\n<p>• ⚛️ React: frontend framework that powers our dashboard and embed widget.</p>\n<p>• 🔥 Firebase: our real-time database, Firebase Storage for file upload, and\nFirebase Functions for event-based server architecture.</p>\n<p>• 💳 Stripe: Atlas for the business, Stripe Elements for secure payment\nprocessing, and Stripe Connect for transferring profits securely to sellers.</p>\n<p>• 👕 Printful: the API-based printing and fulfillment service we integrate with\nfor handling orders.</p>\n<h3>Building interest and finding our first users</h3>\n<p>• We gave a talk at a conference at a <a href="http://atlaslocal.com">local coworking</a>\nspace to get early feedback on the idea and find beta testers.</p>\n<p>• Won the 48-hour <a href="http://nodeknockout.com">Node Knockout</a> hackathon in the\nmiddle of the ProductHunt hackathon (hackathonception!). This was a crash-course\nin integrating with Printful and validating that the idea was technically\nfeasible. We used this as an opportunity to get feedback and find customers\ninterested in custom physical products.</p>\n<p>• Reached out to local charities to offer a way for our users to donate their\nprofits. We’re in talks with more charities and hope to add them to our partner\nlist soon.</p>\n<p>• Connected with local artists and designers to get our first real TinyMerch\nusers.</p>\n<p>• <a href="https://twitter.com/tinymerch/status/925861317231116294">Live-tweeted</a> our\nhackathon design and development progress this month.</p>\n<p>Try TinyMerch To see a store in action, check out our\n<a href="http://tinymerch.com/demo">TinyMerch Demo Store</a>.</p>\n<p>Want to create your own TinyMerch store?\n<a href="https://my.tinymerch.com">Get started now</a> and have a store on your site\nselling 💯 original content in a matter of minutes!</p>\n<p>Interested in getting these updates in your inbox?\n(<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/tiny-merch">Sign Up for Our Newsletter</a>)</p>\n<p>✌️ Best, The TinyMerch Team</p>',frontmatter:{date:"November 30, 2017",path:"/blog/ph-hackathon",title:"2017 PH Hackathon"}}},pathContext:{prev:!1,next:{html:"<h3>👋 everyone,</h3>\n<h1>Donating with TinyMerch</h1>\n<p>When we were building TinyMerch, our goal was to make selling physical products\non your website as quick and easy as possible.
