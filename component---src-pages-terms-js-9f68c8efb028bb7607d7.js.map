By using our Services, you’re agreeing to our communication\n          methods which describes how we provide that information to you. This\n          simply means that we reserve the right to send you information\n          electronically (by email, etc.) instead of mailing you paper copies\n          (it’s better for the environment).\n        </p>\n        <h5>\n          Warranties and Limitation of Liability (or the Things You Can’t Sue Us\n          For) Items Your clients Purchase through our sites.\n        </h5>\n        <p>\n          You understand that TinyMerch Inc. cannot and does not make any\n          warranties about our clients' images, content, stores, or what they\n          sell to their end customer that we may warehouse.

We consider many\n          different and often divergent factors before coming to a decision\n          about what is best for our company, communities, and clients. Because\n          we are a creatively neutral company, we err on the side of freedom of\n          expression. We also tend to allow items that have educational,\n          historical, or artistic value, but we know that even those items are\n          subject to a variety of valid and sometimes conflicting\n          interpretations and emotional responses. Art and history can be\n          provocative, emotional, and divisive. There are some topics on which\n          we may never reach a consensus as a society, and that is okay.\n        </p>\n        <h5>Third-Party Services.</h5>\n        <p>\n          Our stores on our site(s) may contain links to third-party websites or\n          services that we don’t own or control (for example, links to Facebook,\n          Twitter, and Pinterest). You may also need to use a third party’s\n          product or service in order to use some of our Services (like a\n          compatible mobile device to use our mobile apps). When you access\n          these third-party services, you do so at your own risk. The third\n          parties may require you to accept their own terms of use. TinyMerch\n          Inc. is not a party to those agreements; they are solely between you\n          and the third party. Warranties. TinyMerch Inc. is dedicated to making\n          our Services the best they can be, but we’re not perfect and sometimes\n          things can go wrong. You understand that our Services are provided “as\n          is” and without any kind of warranty (express or implied). We are\n          expressly disclaiming any warranties of title, non-infringement,\n          merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose, as well as any\n          warranties implied by a course of performance, course of dealing, or\n          usage of trade.\n        </p>\n        <h5>We do not guarantee that:</h5>\n        <p>\n          The Services will be secure or available at any particular time or\n          location; any defects or errors will be corrected; the Services will\n          always be free of viruses or other harmful materials; or the results\n          of using the Services will meet your expectations. You use the\n          Services solely at your own risk. Some jurisdictions do not allow\n          limitations on implied warranties, so the above limitations may not\n          apply to you Liability Limits. To the fullest extent permitted by law,\n          neither TinyMerch Inc., nor our employees or directors shall be liable\n          to you for any lost profits or revenues, or for any consequential,\n          incidental, indirect, special, or punitive damages arising out of or\n          in connection with the Services or these Terms.

Some\n          jurisdictions do not allow limitations on incidental or consequential\n          damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.\n        </p>\n        <h5>Indemnification (or What Happens If You Get Us Sued)</h5>\n        <p>\n          We hope this never happens, but in the instance TinyMerch Inc. should\n          get sued because of something that you did, you agree to defend and\n          indemnify us. That means you’ll defend TinyMerch Inc. (including any\n          of our employees) and hold us harmless from any legal claim or demand\n          (including reasonable attorney’s fees) that arises from your actions,\n          your use (or misuse) of our Services, your breach of the Terms, or\n          your account’s infringement of someone else’s rights. <br />\n          <br />We reserve the right to handle our legal defense however we see\n          fit, even if you are indemnifying us, in which case you agree to\n          cooperate with us so we can execute our strategy.\n        </p>\n        <h5>Disputes with TinyMerch Inc.</h5>\n        <p>\n          If you’re upset with us, let us know right away, and hopefully we can\n          resolve your issue. But if we can’t, then these rules will govern any\n          legal dispute involving our Services:\n        </p>\n        <h5>Governing Law.</h5>\n        <p>\n          The Terms are governed by the laws of the State in which TinyMerch\n          resides as an organizational facility, without regard to its conflict\n          of laws rules, and the laws of the United States of America. These\n          laws will apply no matter where in the world you live, but if you live\n          outside of the United States, you may be entitled to the protection of\n          the mandatory consumer protection provisions of your local consumer\n          protection law.\n        </p>\n        <h5>Arbitration.</h5>\n        <p>\n          You and TinyMerch Inc. agree that any dispute or claim arising from or\n          relating to the Terms shall be finally settled by final and binding\n          arbitration, using the English language, administered by the American\n          Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration\n          Rule in effect at that time (those rules are deemed to be incorporated\n          by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms you\n          can find them here or by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879).\n          Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with\n          those rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any\n          court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under the Terms will take\n          place on an individual basis—class arbitrations and class actions are\n          not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to the Terms, you and\n          TinyMerch Inc. are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to\n          participate in a class action or class arbitration. Notwithstanding\n          the foregoing, each party shall have the right to bring an action in a\n          court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable or\n          conservatory relief, pending a final decision by the arbitrator. You\n          may instead assert your claim in “small claims” court, but only if\n          your claim qualifies, your claim remains in such court, and your claim\n          remains on an individual, non-representative, and non-class basis.\n        </p>\n        <h5>Costs of Arbitration.</h5>\n        <p>\n          Payment for any and all reasonable AAA filing, administrative, and\n          arbitrator fees will be in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration\n          Rules. If the value of your claim does not exceed $10,000, TinyMerch\n          Inc. will pay for the reasonable filing, administrative, and\n          arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the arbitrator\n          finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was\n          frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.\n        </p>\n        <h5>Forum.</h5>\n        <p>\n          We’re based in multiple states so any legal action against TinyMerch\n          Inc. related to our Services must be filed and take place in the state\n          of choice solely reserved by TinyMerch Inc. That means the seat of any\n          arbitration shall be in any state TinyMerch chooses. For any actions\n          not subject to arbitration, you (where your contract is with TinyMerch\n          Inc.) and TinyMerch Inc. agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction\n          of a state court located in Los Angeles County, CA, or Mecklenburg\n          County, NC, or (where your contract is confirmed with TinyMerch Inc.\n          in Europe) you and TinyMerch Inc. agree to submit to the personal\n          jurisdiction of the courts of Riga, Latvia.\n        </p>\n        <h5>Modifications.</h5>\n        <p>\n          If we make any changes to this “Disputes with TinyMerch Inc.” section\n          after the date you last accepted the Terms, those changes will not\n          apply to any claims filed in a legal proceeding against TinyMerch Inc.\n          prior to the date the changes became effective.

If you do not agree to the modified terms, you\n          may send TinyMerch Inc. a written notification (including email) or\n          close your account within those 30 days of notice.\n        </p>\n        <h5>Rejection of Modification:</h5>\n        <p>\n          By rejecting a modified term or permanently closing your account, you\n          agree to arbitrate any disputes between you and TinyMerch Inc. in\n          accordance with the provisions of this “Disputes with TinyMerch Inc.”\n          section as of the date you last accepted the Terms, including any\n          changes made prior to your rejection. If you leave open or reopen your\n          closed account or create a new account, you agree to be bound by the\n          current version of the Terms of Service and Conditions.\n        </p>\n        <h5>Changes to the Terms and Conditions of Content</h5>\n        <p>\n          We may update these Terms from time to time. If we believe that the\n          changes are material, we’ll definitely let you know by doing one (or\n          more) of the following: (1) posting the changes through the Services\n          or (2) sending you an email or message about the changes. That way you\n          can decide whether you want to continue using the Services. Changes\n          will be effective upon the posting of the changes.

Your use of the\n          Services following the changes constitutes your acceptance of the\n          updated Terms.\n        </p>\n        <h5>Some Finer Legal Points</h5>\n        <p>\n          The Terms and Conditions for content, including all of the guidelines\n          and policy that make up the Terms in totality, supersede any other\n          agreement between you and TinyMerch Inc. regarding the Services. If\n          any part of the Terms is found to be unenforceable, that part will be\n          limited to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms will\n          otherwise remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any\n          part of the Terms is not a waiver of our right to later enforce that\n          or any other part of the Terms. We may assign any of our rights and\n          obligations under the Terms.\n        </p>\n        <h3>4.

Without limiting other\n          remedies, we may limit, suspend or terminate our Service and User\n          accounts, prohibit access to our Site, delay or remove hosted Content,\n          and take technical and legal steps to keep Users off the Site if we\n          think that they are creating problems, possible legal liabilities, or\n          acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of our policies.

Payments and fees</h3>\n        <p>\n          TinyMerch may save Member's credit or debit card information and use\n          it for all future shipments and charges, which will automatically be\n          charged to the saved card, unless the Member notifies TinyMerch\n          through the Site.

Discounts are awarded only to Users\n          over certain threshold of monthly revenue in the preceding calendar\n          month. These tiers are listed on our Site and are subject to change.\n          TinyMerch at its sole discretion may change, suspend or discontinue\n          these discounts at any time.\n        </p>\n        <h3>6. Local taxes</h3>\n        <p>\n          User is responsible for (and shall charge) all sales taxes, VAT and\n          other taxes and duties associated with the Products (if and as\n          applicable). If the User is located in California or North Carolina,\n          it is required to provide a valid California Resale Certificate or\n          North Carolina Resale Certificate or all orders sent to California/\n          North Carolina are subject to California/North Carolina sales tax\n          rates on top of retail rates. <br />\n          <br /> If the User is located in California, California tax rate is\n          calculated as a percentage of retail price when it is provided to\n          TinyMerch by User. When retail price of goods is unknown, TinyMerch\n          calculates tax rate from TinyMerch price plus 10% in accordance with\n          California Regulation 1706 if goods are shipped to California, or tax\n          rate from TinyMerch price if goods are shipped to North Carolina.\n        </p>\n        <h3>7. Shipping and returns</h3>\n        <p>\n          Once you have clicked on the \"confirm\" button, it might be not\n          possible to edit or cancel your order. If you want to change some\n          parameters, Customer addresses, etc., please check whether such an\n          option is available in your account. We are not bound to make such\n          modifications in your order, but we will do our best on a case-by-case\n          basis. Replacement of Products and credits to the Member's account for\n          Products claimed as damaged or not received are subject to TinyMerch\n          investigation and discretion.<br />\n          <br /> The risk of loss and title for such items pass to the User upon\n          our delivery to the carrier. It is the Customer's responsibility to\n          file any claim with a carrier for a lost shipment if carrier tracking\n          indicates that the Product was delivered. In such case TinyMerch will\n          not make any refunds and will not resend the Product. <br />\n          <br />TinyMerch will review replacement/return requests only (a) if\n          there will be missing or broken Product, or a print error if it is\n          TinyMerch fault and (b) if TinyMerch will receive a complaint within\n          30 days from the day the Product was delivered to the Customer (or\n          within 30 days after the estimated delivery date, if the Product is\n          missing).\n        </p>\n        <h3>8. Description of products</h3>\n        <p>\n          Whilst many component parts of our Products are standard, all Products\n          available for purchase are described on their specific design page on\n          our Site. We always try to represent each design as accurately as\n          possible via photography and copy points provided by designers,\n          artists or photographers. <br />\n          <br />We have a policy of continuous Product development so we can\n          provide you with what we consider the best design combined with best\n          performance, and thus reserve the right to amend the specifications of\n          Products, their price, packaging and any Service associated at any\n          time, without prior notice. Before ordering, we thus invite you to\n          have a close look at the Product description and design. <br />\n          <br />We use our best efforts to provide you with the best images and\n          descriptions, but unfortunately cannot guarantee that colours and\n          details in website images are 100% accurate representations of the\n          product, and sizes might in some cases be approximate. <br />\n          <br />Sometimes during the manufacturing process Products can be\n          damaged, obviously they won't be shipped out to Users and Customers,\n          however they can still be used for charitable purposes. TinyMerch\n          reserves the right to donate all damaged items with full or partial\n          designs to charity and the User hereby waives its right to collect\n          royalties or other fees regarding damaged products that are donated.\n        </p>\n        <h3>9. Purchase of products</h3>\n        <p>\n          Your order represents an offer to us to purchase a Product which is\n          accepted by us once we have sent you an e-mail order confirmation. Any\n          Products on the same order which we have not confirmed in a order\n          confirmation e-mail do not form part of that contract. <br />\n          <br />TinyMerch shall under no circumstances be held liable for any\n          special losses due to specific circumstances of the User an/or\n          Customer, indirect or consequential losses or wasted expenditure.\n          <br />\n          <br />Orders are placed and received exclusively via the Site. Before\n          ordering from us, it is the Member's responsibility to check and\n          determine full ability to receive the Products. Correct Customer’s\n          address and post code/zip code, User’s up-to-date telephone number and\n          e-mail address are absolutely necessary to ensure successful delivery\n          of Products. <br />\n          <br />All information asked on the checkout page must be filled in\n          precisely and accurately. TinyMerch will not be responsible for missed\n          delivery because of a wrong delivery address or an inappropriate phone\n          number. Should you like to ask for a change in the delivery address,\n          notify change in a phone number or any other special requirements,\n          please contact TinyMerch.\n        </p>\n        <h3>10. Delivery</h3>\n        <p>\n          We deliver to Users/Customers to most places in the world. User shall\n          cover delivery costs. Delivery prices are additional to the Product’s\n          price and may vary depending on delivery location and/or sort of\n          Products, and additional charges may be added to the order for remote\n          or difficult to access locations that require special attention. Flat\n          rate delivery charges are shown on our checkout page; however we\n          reserve the right to advise you of any additional delivery charges\n          that apply to your specific delivery address. <br />\n          <br />Some sort of Products are packaged and shipped separately. We\n          can not guarantee delivery dates and accept no responsibility, apart\n          from advising you of any known delay, for Products that are delivered\n          after the estimated delivery date. Flat rate delivery times are shown\n          on the Site. It is only an average estimation, and some delivery can\n          take longer, or alternatively be delivered much faster. All delivery\n          estimates given at the time of placing and confirming order are\n          subject to change. In any case, we will do our best to contact you and\n          advise you of all changes. We try our best to make delivery of Product\n          as simple as possible. <br />\n          <br />Ownership of the Products will only pass to you/Customer when we\n          receive full payment of all sums due in respect of the Products,\n          including delivery charges and taxes.\n        </p>\n        <h3>11.
