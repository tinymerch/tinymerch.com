We also tend to allow items that have educational, historical,\n          or artistic value, but we know that even those items are subject to a variety of valid and\n          sometimes conflicting interpretations and emotional responses. Art and history can be\n          provocative, emotional, and divisive. There are some topics on which we may never reach a\n          consensus as a society, and that is okay.\n        </p>\n        <h5>Third-Party Services.</h5>\n        <p>\n          Our stores on our site(s) may contain links to third-party websites or services that we\n          don’t own or control (for example, links to Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest). You may\n          also need to use a third party’s product or service in order to use some of our Services\n          (like a compatible mobile device to use our mobile apps). When you access these\n          third-party services, you do so at your own risk. The third parties may require you to\n          accept their own terms of use. TinyMerch Inc. is not a party to those agreements; they are\n          solely between you and the third party. Warranties. TinyMerch Inc. is dedicated to making\n          our Services the best they can be, but we’re not perfect and sometimes things can go\n          wrong. You understand that our Services are provided “as is” and without any kind of\n          warranty (express or implied). We are expressly disclaiming any warranties of title,\n          non-infringement, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose, as well as any\n          warranties implied by a course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade.\n        </p>\n        <h5>We do not guarantee that:</h5>\n        <p>\n          The Services will be secure or available at any particular time or location; any defects\n          or errors will be corrected; the Services will always be free of viruses or other harmful\n          materials; or the results of using the Services will meet your expectations. You use the\n          Services solely at your own risk. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied\n          warranties, so the above limitations may not apply to you Liability Limits. To the fullest\n          extent permitted by law, neither TinyMerch Inc., nor our employees or directors shall be\n          liable to you for any lost profits or revenues, or for any consequential, incidental,\n          indirect, special, or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with the Services\n          or these Terms. In no event shall TinyMerch Inc.’s aggregate liability for any damages\n          exceed the greater of one hundred ($100) US Dollars or the amount you paid TinyMerch Inc.\n          in the past twelve months, whichever is least. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations\n          on incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.\n        </p>\n        <h5>Indemnification (or What Happens If You Get Us Sued)</h5>\n        <p>\n          We hope this never happens, but in the instance TinyMerch Inc. should get sued because of\n          something that you did, you agree to defend and indemnify us. That means you’ll defend\n          TinyMerch Inc. (including any of our employees) and hold us harmless from any legal claim\n          or demand (including reasonable attorney’s fees) that arises from your actions, your use\n          (or misuse) of our Services, your breach of the Terms, or your account’s infringement of\n          someone else’s rights. <br />\n          <br />We reserve the right to handle our legal defense however we see fit, even if you are\n          indemnifying us, in which case you agree to cooperate with us so we can execute our\n          strategy.\n        </p>\n        <h5>Disputes with TinyMerch Inc.</h5>\n        <p>\n          If you’re upset with us, let us know right away, and hopefully we can resolve your issue.\n          But if we can’t, then these rules will govern any legal dispute involving our Services:\n        </p>\n        <h5>Governing Law.</h5>\n        <p>\n          The Terms are governed by the laws of the State in which TinyMerch resides as an\n          organizational facility, without regard to its conflict of laws rules, and the laws of the\n          United States of America. These laws will apply no matter where in the world you live, but\n          if you live outside of the United States, you may be entitled to the protection of the\n          mandatory consumer protection provisions of your local consumer protection law.\n        </p>\n        <h5>Arbitration.</h5>\n        <p>\n          You and TinyMerch Inc. agree that any dispute or claim arising from or relating to the\n          Terms shall be finally settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English\n          language, administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its\n          Commercial Arbitration Rule in effect at that time (those rules are deemed to be\n          incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms you can\n          find them here or by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879). Arbitration will be handled by a\n          sole arbitrator in accordance with those rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be\n          entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under the Terms will take\n          place on an individual basis—class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You\n          understand that by agreeing to the Terms, you and TinyMerch Inc. are each waiving the\n          right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration.\n          Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to bring an action in a\n          court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable or conservatory relief,\n          pending a final decision by the arbitrator. You may instead assert your claim in “small\n          claims” court, but only if your claim qualifies, your claim remains in such court, and\n          your claim remains on an individual, non-representative, and non-class basis.\n        </p>\n        <h5>Costs of Arbitration.</h5>\n        <p>\n          Payment for any and all reasonable AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees will be\n          in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules. If the value of your claim does not\n          exceed $10,000, TinyMerch Inc. will pay for the reasonable filing, administrative, and\n          arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the arbitrator finds that either\n          the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous or brought for an improper\n          purpose.\n        </p>\n        <h5>Forum.</h5>\n        <p>\n          We’re based in multiple states so any legal action against TinyMerch Inc. related to our\n          Services must be filed and take place in the state of choice solely reserved by TinyMerch\n          Inc. That means the seat of any arbitration shall be in any state TinyMerch chooses. For\n          any actions not subject to arbitration, you (where your contract is with TinyMerch Inc.)\n          and TinyMerch Inc. agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located\n          in Greenville County, SC.\n        </p>\n        <h5>Changes to the Terms and Conditions of Content</h5>\n        <p>\n          We may update these Terms from time to time. Your use of the Services following the\n          changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.\n        </p>\n        <h5>Some Finer Legal Points</h5>\n        <p>\n          The Terms and Conditions for content, including all of the guidelines and policy that make\n          up the Terms in totality, supersede any other agreement between you and TinyMerch Inc.\n          regarding the Services. If any part of the Terms is found to be unenforceable, that part\n          will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms will otherwise remain in\n          full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any part of the Terms is not a waiver of our\n          right to later enforce that or any other part of the Terms. We may assign any of our\n          rights and obligations under the Terms.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Responsibility of site members and visitors</h3>\n        <p>\n          Violation of any of this Agreement or other rules will result in the termination of your\n          TinyMerch account. <br />\n          <br />TinyMerch and its designees shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their\n          sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or remove any Content that is available via the\n          TinyMerch Services. <br />\n          <br />TinyMerch shall have the right to remove any Content.

We also reserve the right to\n          cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for extended periods of\n          time.

If the User has provided TinyMerch with inaccurate\n          or false information, (a) the User shall be liable to TinyMerch for damages and losses\n          (including but not limited to taxes) arising out of such inaccurate or false information\n          and (b) the User shall reimburse such damages and losses (including but not limited to\n          taxes) to TinyMerch, and (c) TinyMerch shall have the right to charge the Client for such\n          damages and losses (including but not limited to taxes).\n        </p>\n        <h3>Payments and fees</h3>\n        <p>\n          TinyMerch may choose to change the fees for our Services.\n          <br />\n          <br /> By placing an order through the Site, you are confirming that you are legally\n          entitled to use the means of payment tendered and, in the case of card payments, that you\n          are either the cardholder or have the cardholder's express permission to utilise the card\n          to effect payment. <br />\n          <br />In case of an unfounded chargeback, the User shall reimburse TinyMerch for its\n          losses, which consist of fulfillment costs and chargeback handling fees ($15 USD per\n          chargeback). <br />\n          <br /> We may refuse to process a transaction for any reason or refuse Service to anyone\n          at any time at our sole discretion. We will not be liable to you or any third party by\n          reason of refusing or suspending any transaction after processing has begun. <br />\n          <br /> Unless otherwise stated, all fees and payments are quoted in U.S. Dollars.

After receiving your order you will receive an e-mail from us confirming the\n          details, description and price for the Products ordered together with some information on\n          your rights to return your goods. Payment of the total price plus taxes and delivery must\n          be made in full before dispatch of your Products. <br />\n          <br /> Payouts to a Member's bank account or debit card may incur a $.25 transaction fee.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Shipping and returns</h3>\n        <p>\n          Once you have clicked on the \"purchase\" button, it might be not possible to edit or cancel\n          your order.

We are not bound to make such modifications in your order, but we will do our\n          best on a case-by-case basis. Replacement of Products are subject to TinyMerch\n          investigation and discretion.<br />\n          <br /> The risk of loss and title for such items pass to the User upon our delivery to the\n          carrier. It is the Customer's responsibility to file any claim with a carrier for a lost\n          shipment if carrier tracking indicates that the Product was delivered. In such case\n          TinyMerch will not make any refunds and will not resend the Product. <br />\n        </p>\n        <h3>Description of products</h3>\n        <p>\n          Whilst many component parts of our Products are standard, all Products available for\n          purchase are described on their specific design page on our Site.

User shall cover delivery costs. Delivery prices are\n          additional to the Product’s price and may vary depending on delivery location and/or sort\n          of Products, and additional charges may be added to the order for remote or difficult to\n          access locations that require special attention. Flat rate delivery charges are shown on\n          our checkout page; however we reserve the right to advise you of any additional delivery\n          charges that apply to your specific delivery address. <br />\n          <br />Some sort of Products are packaged and shipped separately. We can not guarantee\n          delivery dates and accept no responsibility, apart from advising you of any known delay,\n          for Products that are delivered after the estimated delivery date. Flat rate delivery\n          times are shown on the Site. It is only an average estimation, and some delivery can take\n          longer, or alternatively be delivered much faster.
