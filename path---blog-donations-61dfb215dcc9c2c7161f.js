With TinyMerch you can select a product, (we currently offer t-shirts 👕 &#x26; posters 🖼️ with more products, along with digital files, coming soon!), add a custom design, such as your company’s logo or a fun illustration, really whatever you’d like! And just like that, you have a product available in your store! After this it’s just a matter of adding our script to your site and voilà! You have a store on your site that people can purchase branded, custom content from.</p>\n<p>TinyMerch is perfect for limited runs, promotions, or to simply add a store to your website for the holidays 🎄. There’s no inventory, no monthly fee, no hassle or worry about staying on top of orders and fulfillment. We take care of all of this for you!</p>\n<p><strong>TinyMerch is a worry-free way for someone to get started in e-commerce.</strong></p>\n<h3>So How Does TinyMerch Work?</h3>\n<p>TinyMerch is a lightweight layer built on top of and Printful’s API and uses Stripe for payment processing. Every time an order is placed we automatically send that request to Printful for fulfillment and shipping. Fulfillment costs are then taken from the total and the remaining profits are sent directly to you via Stripe Connect.</p>\n<p>It is true that all this simplicity comes at a small cost. Your profit margins with us will be lower than if you went to a local printer, placed a large order and then sold them yourselves through a service such as Shopify. If you’re planning on selling a lot, then maybe that’s the route you should take, but if that amount of overhead and maintenance scares you, don’t let keep you from selling your designs.</p>\n<p><strong>You’re who we made TinyMerch for!</strong></p>\n<h3>See a Demo Store:</h3>\n<p>If you want to see a store in action you can checkout the Demo Store on <a href="https://tinymerch.com/demo">tinymerch.com</a></p>\n<h3>See a Demo Store:</h3>\n<p>Already convinced this is for you?\nYou can <a href="https://my.tinymerch.com">Get Started Now!</a> and have a store on your site selling 💯 original content in a matter of minutes!</p>\n<p>Interested in getting these updates in your inbox?\n(<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/tiny-merch">Sign Up for Our Newsletter</a>)</p>\n<p>✌️ Best,\nThe Tiny Team</p>',id:"/Users/aeryk/Sites/Nicer/TinyMerch/tinymerch/website/src/pages/11-30-2017-upcoming-03/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{date:"2017-11-30",path:"/blog/ph-hackathon",tags:["fourth"],title:"2017 PH Hackathon",postTitle:"Hello Again",postGreeting:"👋 everyone,",postPreview:"Just a quick update on progress here at TinyMerch.

We’ve been hard at work this past week building out a lot of the nitty-gritty innards that\'ll make TinyMerch function. Stuff like setting up Firebase functions, generating print files, connecting with APIs, etc, etc. 😴</p>\n<p>Anyways, on to a couple of the more exciting aspects of TinyMerch. We\'ll be spinning up a TinyMerch Blog (Launching next week!) where we’ll be regularly posting updates, along with helpful tips on setting up your store. We’ve also been working on rounding out our Product Catalog for the Hackathon Launch. We’re currently looking to launch with shirts, prints, and digital files.

With the holidays coming up and many people in need around the world, we created a simple and easy outlet to allow content creators and businesses to donate to select charities with the click of a button. As we finish setting this up, we\'d love to hear from you all about which charities you\'d wish to see available for donations.</p>\n<p>(And for the less benevolent amongst you. . .The answer is yes, our accountant has said this would most likely be deductible.)</p>\n<h3>Feedback Survey:</h3>\n<p><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/t8K8xDOgWTOry5Ew1">https://goo.gl/forms/t8K8xDOgWTOry5Ew1</a></p>\n<p>Interested in getting these updates in your inbox?\n(<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/tiny-merch">Sign Up for Our Newsletter</a>)</p>\n<p>✌️ Best,\nThe Tiny Team</p>',id:"/Users/aeryk/Sites/Nicer/TinyMerch/tinymerch/website/src/pages/11-17-2017-upcoming-02/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{date:"2017-11-17",path:"/blog/upcoming-02",tags:["second"],title:"Tiny Update #02",postTitle:"Hello Again",postGreeting:"👋 everyone,",postPreview:"Just a quick update on progress here at TinyMerch.
